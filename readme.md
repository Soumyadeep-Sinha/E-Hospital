PLEASE READ THE CONTENTS IN ORDER TO AVOID ERRORS

Thank you for visiting my page.
This is a hospital management project based on MongoDB and Mongoose
Tools used :
1) Node Js
2) Express Js
3) EJS
4) HTML
5) CSS
6) NPM --> express, body-parser, ejs, mongoose, express-sessions,mongodb-session

NOTE : The project is configured to run on Localhost:3000 by default.
but can be configured to run on cloud MongoDB Atlas Servers.

Functionalities :

--> User can create an account
--> login using the credentials
--> view or update information 
--> deregester (delete account)

--> Now after login, a session will be created and the session can be destroyed after clicking logout button.

--> User can register any patient in any department (currently : in Anesthesiology and cardiology)
--> then they can print receipt 
--> if required they can cancel the registration.

Features :
--> Dynamic Home page 
--> Dynamic Patient Registration Page.
--> Full CRUD functions to the USER.
--> Create and Delete function for patient registration.
--> Pages can be translated in any Language with the help of google translate API
--> One click print function on receipt page.
--> Mobile optimized.
--> Dynamic error and alert pages.

Things to take care : 

--> Navigation bar (header) is partially fuctional (I plan to change the navbar style in future).
--> additional Node modules might be needed.
--> The app.js has some console logs wich are unecessary but I have kept them for debugging purposes.
