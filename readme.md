PLEASE READ THE CONTENTS IN ORDER TO AVOID ERRORS

Thank you for visiting my page.
This is a hospital management project based on MongoDB and Mongoose
Tools used :
1) Node Js
2) Express Js
3) EJS
4) HTML
5) CSS
6) NPM --> express, body-parser, ejs, mongoose

NOTE : The project is meant to run on Localhost:300 by default.
but can be configured to run on cloud MongoDB Atlas Servers.

Functionalities :

--> User can create an account
--> login using the credentials
--> view or update information 
--> deregester (delete account)

--> User can register any patient in any department (currently : in Anesthesiology and cardiology)
--> then they can print receipt 
--> if required they can cancel the registration.

Features :
--> Dynamic Home page 
--> Dynamic Patient Registration Page.
--> Full CRUD functions to the USER.
--> Create and Delete function for patient registration.
--> Pages can be translated in any Language with the help of google translate API
--> One click print function on receipt page.

Things to take care : 

--> Navigation bar (header) is not fuctional (I plan to change the navbar style in future). It is just a dummy.
--> additional Node modules might be needed.
--> The pages are not mobile optimized (Front-end was not my priority)
--> I may fix the rsponsiveness in future.
--> The app.js has some console logs wich are unecessary but I have kept them for debugging purposes.
